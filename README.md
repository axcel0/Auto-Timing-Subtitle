# auto_timing_subtitle
auto timing japanese subtitle using [Whisper](https://github.com/openai/whisper) and [faster-whisper](https://github.com/SYSTRAN/faster-whisper)

Program is based on [faster-whisper](https://github.com/SYSTRAN/faster-whisper), a reimplementation of OpenAI's [Whisper](https://github.com/openai/whisper) , a general-prupose speech recognition model. This implementation is up to 4 times faster than original Whisper for the same accuracy while using less memory.

The output file will be in Advanced SubStation Alpha(ass) format with built-in style of selected sub group so it can be directly imported into [Aegisub](https://github.com/Aegisub/Aegisub) for subsequent editing.
